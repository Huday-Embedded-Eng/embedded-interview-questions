Interview questions and answers for Embedded Systems, C/C++, ARM

--> 1.Explain about ARM7 Architecture?

A. ARM7 architecture is an older generation 32-bit RISC-based processor architecture.
It follows a Von Neumann architecture, where instructions and data share the same memory and bus.

ARM7 uses a 3-stage pipeline consisting of Fetch, Decode, and Execute, which improves instruction throughput.

It supports two instruction sets:
ARM mode, which uses 32-bit instructions
Thumb mode, which uses 16-bit instructions to improve code density and memory efficiency

ARM7TDMI-S stands for:

T – Thumb instruction support
D – On-chip debug support
M – Fast hardware multiplier
I – EmbeddedICE integrated circuit emulator 
S – Synthesizable core

Due to its low power consumption and simplicity, ARM7 is widely used in embedded systems such as microcontrollers.

--> 2.Difference between ARM7 and ARM Cortex M0+ Architecture ?

A. ARM7 is an older generation 32-bit RISC-based processor mainly designed for embedded control applications.
It follows a Von Neumann architecture, where instructions and data share the same memory and bus, which can lead to bus contention.
ARM7 does not include advanced features like NVIC, low-latency interrupts, or modern power-saving mechanisms.

ARM Cortex-M0 is a newer, low-power 32-bit RISC-based microcontroller core designed for real-time and IoT applications.
It follows a modified Harvard architecture, with separate instruction and data buses, allowing faster execution.
Cortex-M0 includes features like NVIC (Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller), better interrupt latency, and lower power consumption.

Due to these improvements, Cortex-M0 is preferred over ARM7 in modern embedded and IoT systems, though Wi-Fi is provided through external modules, not the core itself.

--> 3. Difference between von-neumann and Hardvard architecture ?

A.Von Neumann → Single memory, single bus, one operation at a time

Harvard → Separate memory, separate buses, parallel operations

--> 4. Explain about LPC2148 mcu?

A. LPC2148 is an ARM7-based 32-bit RISC microcontroller with a maximum clock speed of 60 MHz. It includes on-chip Flashmemory 512kb, SRAM 32kb, 10-bit ADC, DAC, UART, I2C, SPI, PWM, RTC, and supports EmbeddedICE for debugging. It is widely used in low-power embedded applications.

--> 5. Explain about Raspberry pi pico W ?

A.RP2040 is a dual-core 32-bit RISC microcontroller based on ARM Cortex-M0+, used in Raspberry Pi Pico W. It uses a modified Harvard architecture and runs at up to 133 MHz. It has 264 KB on-chip SRAM and uses external QSPI Flash (typically 2 MB). It supports a 12-bit ADC, GPIO, UART, SPI, I2C, PWM, timers, RTC, and Pico W adds Wi-Fi, making it suitable for IoT applications.


--> 6. What is a Core?
Answer:
A core is the main part of a processor that executes instructions. It contains the ALU, registers, and control unit.

--> 7. What is the difference between Core and Processor?
Answer:
A core executes instructions, while a processor may contain one or more cores.

--> 8. What is bare-metal programming?
Answer:
Bare-metal programming is writing code that runs directly on hardware without an OS.

--> 9. Interrupt vs polling?
Answer:
Polling continuously checks a condition, while an interrupt notifies the CPU only when an event occurs.

--> 10. What is volatile keyword?
Answer:
volatile tells the compiler that a variable can change unexpectedly, so it should not optimize it.

--> 11. Difference between C and Embedded C?
Answer:
Embedded C is an extension of c used to write programs for hardware control with direct register access.
where as C is a general-purpose programming language used to develop software applications, supporting both low-level and high-level programming concepts.

--> 12. What is static keyword?
Answer:
static preserves variable value between function calls and limits scope.

--> 13. Macro vs function?
Answer:
Macros are preprocessor directives with no type checking, while functions are compiled and safer.

--> 14. What is bit masking?
Answer:
Bit masking is used to set, clear, or toggle specific bits in a register.

-->15. What is memory-mapped I/O?
Answer:
Peripheral registers are accessed like memory locations using pointers.

-->16.What is pipeline?
Answer:
Pipeline divides instruction execution into stages to increase speed.

-->17. What is NVIC?
Answer:
NVIC handles interrupt prioritization and control in Cortex-M processors.

-->18. What is vector table?
Answer:
A vector table stores addresses of interrupt service routines.

-->19. What precautions in ISR?
Answer:
ISR should be short, avoid delays, and not use blocking functions.

--> 20. What is interrupt latency?
Answer:
Time taken from interrupt occurrence to ISR execution.

--> 21. What is hex file?
Answer:
Hex file contains machine code to be flashed into MCU.

--> 22. What is const?
Answer:
const prevents modification of a variable after initialization.

--> 23.What causes stack overflow?
Answer:
Deep recursion, large local variables, or infinite function calls.

--> 24. What is typedef?
Answer:
typedef creates an alias name for a data type.

--> 26. What is a timer?
Answer:
A hardware counter used for delays, event timing, and interrupts.

-->  27. Why C is used in embedded systems?
Answer:
Efficient, fast, hardware-level control.

--> 28. Why volatile is used with bitwise register access?
Answer:
To prevent compiler optimization of hardware registers.

--> 29. How do you set a bit?
num = num | (1 << pos);

--> 29. How do you clear a bit?
num = num & ~(1 << pos);

--> 30. How do you toggle a bit?
num = num ^ (1 << pos);

--> 31. How do you check if a bit is set?
if(num & (1 << pos))
    printf("Bit is set");
